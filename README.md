# Vitesse – Candidate Management App (iOS)

Vitesse is an iOS application built with **SwiftUI** and following the **MVVM architecture**.  
The app focuses on user authentication and candidate management, with a strong emphasis on clean architecture, security, and user experience.

This project was designed as a technical exercise to demonstrate best practices in modern iOS development for Open Classrooms in january 2026.

## ✨ Features Overview

### 🔐 Authentication

- User registration with form validation
- Secure login using email and password
- Password confirmation and protected input fields
- Authentication based on **JWT (JSON Web Token)**
- The JWT token is securely stored and used to maintain the authenticated session
- Robust error handling with clear user feedback

---

### 👥 Candidate Management

- Display a list of candidates
- Search candidates by first name or last name
- Filter candidates by favorite status
- Edit and delete candidates
- View detailed candidate profiles

---

### ⭐ Favorites & Permissions

- Mark candidates as favorites
- Favorite action is restricted to **admin users**
- UI dynamically adapts based on user permissions

---

## 🧱 Architecture

The application follows the **MVVM (Model – View – ViewModel)** pattern:

- **Model**: Represents data structures (User, Candidate, etc.)
- **View**: SwiftUI views responsible only for UI rendering
- **ViewModel**: Handles business logic, state management, validation, and error handling

Each ViewModel relies on **dedicated services**, injected via protocols, to handle data access and business operations.  
This design enables easy mocking of dependencies and allows ViewModels to be tested in isolation.

This separation improves:
- Testability
- Maintainability
- Readability
- Scalability

## 🔒 Security Considerations

Security has been considered from the early stages of the application design.

- Authentication is based on **JWT (JSON Web Token)**
- The JWT token is **securely stored in the Apple Keychain**, ensuring it is encrypted and protected by the system
- Sensitive information such as passwords is never stored or logged
- Password fields use secure text entry and are never displayed in plain text
- Authentication state relies on the presence and validity of the stored token
- User permissions (e.g. admin access) are enforced at both UI and logic levels
- Centralized error handling prevents sensitive information from being exposed to the user

By leveraging **Apple Keychain Services**, the application follows iOS security best practices.
